    "In our ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load) we are working on the premise that certain countries have better policies, cultural attitude towards alternative energy that make them more likely to have a turning point in the EKC.  If the goal is CO2 emmisions, other countries will seek proof of the existence of such policies to effectively enable such turning point, as every nation wishes to both maximize wealth and minize emmissions.  Thus, in spite of the potential critisism that this is an exercise in \"fitting the data to the model\", we feel it has value in a proper test of the existence of the EKC, as most academic literature to this date has failed to do this, either to poor selection of explanatory variables, or simply because the data available was too sparse or inaccurate.   \n",

    "Data on wind power generation in Megawatts is available from Eurostat from 1990 to 2018, but only for very few countries. For some countries the data from early years is strangely replicated identically across years, almost as if a Windmill was built and remained the only unit in operation, then suddenly there is a ramp up. This is a suspicius pattern indeed, for example:\n",
